# TextBlackjack
This is a Java text-based Blackjack AI that tries to optimize the player decisions based on a statistical analysis of the probability of getting a card over 21 and using that to drive the choices of the "Player". It also calculates the win-rate that the AI got out of 1 million attempts and tries to optimize the strategy.
This is the deprecated version of this project https://github.com/Swegoverload456/BlackjackAI
